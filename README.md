# transaction-app

## Task overview
Create a React application for managing transactions. The application should allow users to import a list of transactions from a CSV file, change the status of transactions, delete transactions, and export a filtered list of transactions to a CSV file.

## Technical requirements
1. Status management and data acquisition:
 - Use React Query to manage server state and handle asynchronous operations.
 - Use an embedded SQL database (such as SQLite or a JavaScript library for SQL) to store initial transaction data and simulate API responses.
2. Form processing:
 - Use react-hook-form to handle forms in the application.
 - Implement form validation and error handling.
3. UI Framework:
 - Use ChakraUI for styling and layout.
4. Development tools:
 - Use Vite for project setup and bundling (don't use CRA).
 - TypeScript is required to ensure type safety and code quality.
